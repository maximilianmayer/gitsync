# gitsync

gitsync is a dead simple ruby tool to help you manage (at least a bit) your git repos
 and get them somehow in sync with your upstream. 

## Getting Started

These instructions will get you a copy of the project up and running on your local machine for development and testing purposes. See deployment for notes on how to deploy the project on a live system.

### Prerequisites

gitsync was written in pure ruby and should work with any ruby version >= 2.1. Nevertheless I suggest to use the latest version.  

In addition to plain ruby you need rubygems installed and at least bundler installed. If you don't have the bundler gem installed, you install it by 
```
gem install bundler
```

### Installing

the easiert way is to either clone (or fork) the repo and link the gitsync.rb in a directory in your $PATH.

## Running the tests

no tests are implemented yet, this will follow later. 

## Deployment
